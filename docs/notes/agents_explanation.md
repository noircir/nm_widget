# NativeMimic AI Development Team Strategy
## Building Your Virtual Software Engineering Team

*Created: August 2025*
*Status: Implementation Guide for AI Agent Team*

---

## Overview: The AI Development Team Concept

You've discovered the ability to create specialized AI agents - essentially building a virtual software engineering team where each "team member" has deep expertise in their domain. This mirrors real startup team structures but with 24/7 availability and perfect memory retention.

---

## How to Create Agents

### Step 1: Use the /agents Command
```bash
# In Claude Code terminal
/agents
```
This opens the agent management interface where you can:
- View existing agents
- Create new agents
- Edit agent configurations

### Step 2: Create Agent Files
Agents are YAML files with this structure:
```yaml
---
name: nativemimic-frontend-dev
description: Frontend specialist for NativeMimic TypeScript/Svelte implementation
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash
---
You are the Frontend Developer for NativeMimic v4.0.

## Your Expertise:
- TypeScript + Svelte + Tailwind CSS
- Browser extension UI components
- Voice coaching interface design
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Your Responsibilities:
- Implement widget overlay components
- Create voice selection interfaces  
- Handle recording controls UI
- Ensure responsive design

## Project Context:
- Working on clean TypeScript rewrite (no JavaScript legacy)
- Target: Professional pronunciation coaching platform
- Brand colors: #6ab354 (primary green), retro 1980s aesthetic
- Architecture: Modular components in 1_CORE_PRODUCT/1.1_user_interface/

Always reference the Strategic Master Plan at docs/business/STRATEGIC_MASTER_PLAN_v4.md for context.
```

### Step 3: Save in Project Directory
```
.claude/agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nativemimic-frontend-dev.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nativemimic-backend-dev.md  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nativemimic-architect.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nativemimic-qa-engineer.md
```

---

## When to Invoke Agents

### Automatic Invocation
Claude Code automatically delegates based on task descriptions:

```bash
# This automatically calls the frontend developer
"Create the voice selector component with TypeScript"

# This calls the backend developer  
"Set up the Supabase Edge Function for TTS proxy"

# This calls the QA engineer
"Review the widget code for security issues"
```

### Explicit Invocation
```bash
# Direct delegation
"Have the nativemimic-architect design the recording system architecture"

# Chained workflow
"System architect: design user auth ‚Üí Backend dev: implement ‚Üí QA: security audit"
```

## Practical Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: Implement Language Detection Component

**You:** "I need to implement the language detection component from content.js"

**Claude Code automatically delegates:**
1. **Architect**: Analyzes content.js, designs LanguageDetector interface
2. **Frontend Dev**: Implements TypeScript component with proper types  
3. **Backend Dev**: Integrates with analytics tracking
4. **QA Engineer**: Creates test suite and reviews for edge cases

### Scenario 2: Chained Workflow
```bash
"Architect: Extract language detection patterns from content.js
‚Üí Frontend dev: Implement LanguageDetector.ts with those patterns  
‚Üí QA: Write comprehensive tests for all language combinations
‚Üí Backend dev: Add analytics tracking for language detection events"
```

### Scenario 3: Complex Feature Implementation
```bash
"I want to add voice quality ratings with crowdsourcing"

# Automatic delegation:
# Architect: Designs rating system architecture
# Frontend dev: Creates rating UI (üëç/üëé buttons)
# Backend dev: Implements rating storage and aggregation
# QA: Tests rating accuracy and prevents gaming
```

## Getting Started Today

### Step 1: Create Your First Agent
1. Run `/agents` in Claude Code
2. Create `nativemimic-architect.md` first
3. Test with: "Have the architect analyze the content.js file and design the LanguageDetector component"

### Step 2: Validate the Concept
Test the architect agent with a simple task:
```bash
"Architect: Review the existing TypeScript files in 1_CORE_PRODUCT/ and identify what needs to be implemented first"
```

### Step 3: Build Your Team Gradually
- **Day 1**: Create architect agent, test with analysis tasks
- **Day 2**: Create frontend dev agent, test with simple component creation
- **Week 1**: Add backend dev for Supabase integration planning
- **Week 2**: Add QA engineer for testing strategy

### Step 4: Establish Workflows
Create standard operating procedures:
- **New Feature**: Architect designs ‚Üí Frontend/Backend implement ‚Üí QA tests
- **Bug Fix**: QA identifies ‚Üí Architect analyzes ‚Üí Appropriate dev fixes
- **Code Review**: All agents review changes in their domain expertise

## Advanced Agent Management

### Agent Specialization
As your project grows, create specialized agents:
```yaml
# Example: Voice Technology Specialist
---
name: nativemimic-voice-specialist
description: Expert in voice processing, TTS APIs, and audio technology
---
You are the Voice Technology Specialist for NativeMimic.
Focus exclusively on TTS integration, voice quality optimization,
caching strategies, and audio processing technology.
```

### Agent Communication
Agents can reference each other's work:
```bash
"Backend dev: Implement the database schema that the architect designed"
"QA: Test the frontend component that the frontend dev just created"
```

### Agent Memory
Each agent maintains conversation context and remembers:
- Previous architectural decisions
- Code patterns and conventions
- Project requirements and constraints
- Lessons learned from failures

---

## Troubleshooting Agent Issues

### Agent Not Responding Correctly:
1. **Check agent description** - Make it more specific
2. **Review project context** - Ensure agent has sufficient background
3. **Refine expertise areas** - Be more explicit about responsibilities
4. **Update tools list** - Ensure agent has access to needed tools

### Agents Contradicting Each Other:
1. **Establish clear boundaries** - Define who owns what decisions
2. **Create coordination protocols** - How agents should communicate
3. **Designate tie-breaker** - Usually the architect for technical decisions
4. **Document decisions** - Maintain shared knowledge base

### Agent Context Loss:
1. **Reference key documents** - Strategic plan, architecture docs
2. **Maintain project summary** - Update agents on major changes
3. **Create shared vocabulary** - Consistent terminology across agents
4. **Regular sync meetings** - Update all agents on project status
