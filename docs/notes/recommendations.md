This is an excellent and comprehensive project plan. It's a significant evolution from the initial high-level scaffolding, providing a detailed, strategic roadmap that covers the full lifecycle of the product. Your structure is logical, thorough, and demonstrates a mature understanding of the technical and business components required for success.

My role now is to integrate the specific, actionable recommendations from our previous discussions into this superior framework. This creates a single, unified plan that combines your detailed structure with key technical and strategic decisions.

Here is the updated and integrated project plan for **NativeMimic**:

***

### **1. CORE PRODUCT**
This section perfectly captures the user-facing elements of the widget. The focus here should be on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience.

*   **1.1 User Interface**
    *   **Recommendation:** Build the UI components using **TypeScript with React or Svelte**. This provides a robust, type-safe environment that will help eliminate the UI/UX bugs you've been experiencing.
    *   **`voice_selection`:** Implement the two-tier selection system: display 3-5 curated, high-quality voices in the main widget (`widget_overlay`) and use the modal for the full, vetted list.
    *   **`settings_panel`:** Ensure this includes clear controls for the data privacy opt-in (`1.3.3`).

*   **1.2 Voice Engine**
    *   **`tts_integration`:** This should not call the Google TTS API directly from the client. All calls must be routed through a secure backend function (`4.1.1`) to protect your API key.
    *   **`audio_caching`:** This is your primary cost-control mechanism. When a sentence is requested for the first time, the generated audio file should be stored in Supabase Storage (`4.1.3`). Subsequent requests for the same sentence pull the cached file, dramatically reducing API costs.
    *   **`voice_filtering`:** Continue your process of manually curating the best voices. This human touch is a quality differentiator.

*   **1.3 Recording System**
    *   **`storage_manager`:** Use Supabase Storage to hold user recordings. Structure the file paths logically (e.g., `/user_id/recordings/timestamp.mp3`).
    *   **`privacy_controls`:** This is critical for user trust. Implement a clear, explicit **opt-in** before any voice recording is stored. The default should always be "do not store."

### **2. PLATFORM INTEGRATION**
This correctly identifies the core challenges of building a browser extension that works across the web.

*   **2.1 Browser Extension**
    *   **`manifest_v3`:** Your choice of a modern stack like TypeScript/React is fully compatible with Manifest V3 requirements.
    *   **`background_service`:** This is the extension's brain. It will handle communication between the content scripts (`2.1.2`), the UI, and your backend services (`4.1`).

*   **2.2 Web Compatibility**
    *   **`cors_handling` & `site_adapters`:** This will be an ongoing effort. Start by targeting a specific set of popular websites (e.g., Wikipedia, major news domains, Medium) to ensure a stable experience on those before trying to achieve universal compatibility.

*   **2.3 Deployment**
    *   **`chrome_store`:** In preparation for your 6-week goal, begin drafting your store listing assets now: a compelling description, high-quality screenshots, and a clear, easy-to-read privacy policy.

### **3. DATA INTELLIGENCE**
This section brilliantly captures the "secret weapon" of your business: the value of the data you collect.

*   **3.1 User Analytics**
    *   **`engagement_tracking`:** Prioritize tracking DAU/MAU, number of recordings per session, and user retention (1-day, 7-day, 30-day). This is essential for proving product-market fit.
    *   **`cost_monitoring`:** Your backend functions should log API usage per user to a table in Supabase. This allows you to monitor costs and enforce limits if necessary.

*   **3.2 Crowdsourced Curation**
    *   **`voice_quality_feedback`:** Implement a simple thumbs-up/thumbs-down button next to the play button. This provides invaluable, low-friction feedback for improving your curated voice lists.

*   **3.3 Business Intelligence**
    *   **`monetization_data`:** This is the output of your analytics. The trend reports on language pairs, geographic demand, and content types are the assets you can monetize by selling to corporate L&D, market research firms, and AI developers.

### **4. INFRASTRUCTURE**
This is the engine room of your product. Getting this right ensures stability, security, and scalability.

*   **4.1 Backend Services (Supabase)**
    *   **`supabase_functions`:** This is where you'll implement the serverless logic. Create two critical Edge Functions immediately:
        1.  **`tts-proxy`:** A function that receives a text snippet from the client, calls the Google TTS API using your secret key, and returns the audio. This keeps your key secure.
        2.  **`rate-limiter`:** A function that checks a user's API usage against their subscription plan before allowing a `tts-proxy` call to proceed.
    *   **`database_schema`:** Design your tables to support your analytics and future AI needs. For example, a `recordings` table should link to the user, the original text, and the URL of the cached native audio.

*   **4.2 Testing Framework**
    *   **`ui_automation`:** This is your highest priority for fixing the UI/UX instability. Use a tool like **Playwright** or **Cypress** to create end-to-end tests that simulate full user workflows.
    *   **`integration_tests`:** Write tests to verify the contracts between your UI and your Supabase functions.

*   **4.3 DevOps**
    *   **`ci_cd_pipeline`:** Set up a basic pipeline using **GitHub Actions**. Configure it to automatically run your full test suite (`4.2`) on every code change to prevent regressions from reaching production.

### **5. FUTURE EXTENSIBILITY**
This forward-looking plan ensures you are building a foundation that can support future growth without a complete rewrite.

*   **5.1 AI Coach Architecture**
    *   **Actionable Step for Today:** The most important thing you can do *now* is to standardize how you store data. By saving the user's audio, the original text, and the native audio file together, you are creating the perfect training dataset for a future `voice_analysis_api`.

*   **5.2 Scaling Preparation**
    *   **`microservices_ready`:** Your use of Supabase Edge Functions is already aligned with a microservices approach. Each function is a small, independent service.
    *   **`cdn_integration`:** Supabase Storage already uses a CDN for file delivery, so you are well-positioned for global performance from day one.

This integrated plan is a powerful blueprint. It validates your detailed vision and enriches it with specific, actionable recommendations to ensure your next six weeks are productive and your long-term architecture is sound.
