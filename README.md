# NativeMimic v4.0 - Modular Architecture

## Project Overview
Complete architectural rewrite of NativeMimic using TypeScript, modern modular design, and proper separation of concerns to eliminate JavaScript complexity and UI instability.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React/Svelte + Tailwind CSS
- **Build**: Vite (faster than webpack)
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions + Auth + Storage
- **Testing**: Playwright (E2E) + Jest (Unit)
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Architecture Principles
1. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns across 5 major domains
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout to eliminate runtime errors
3. **Security First**: API keys protected via backend Edge Functions
4. **Testing Focus**: Comprehensive testing to prevent UI regressions
5. **Future-Ready**: Extensible architecture for AI coaching features

## Directory Structure

### 1. CORE_PRODUCT
User-facing functionality and core business logic
- **1.1_user_interface/**: React/Svelte components with TypeScript
- **1.2_voice_engine/**: TTS integration via secure backend proxy
- **1.3_recording_system/**: Audio capture with privacy controls

### 2. PLATFORM_INTEGRATION  
Browser extension platform and cross-site compatibility
- **2.1_browser_extension/**: Manifest V3 with service workers
- **2.2_web_compatibility/**: Cross-origin and site adaptation
- **2.3_deployment/**: Chrome Web Store and distribution

### 3. DATA_INTELLIGENCE
Analytics, user insights, and business intelligence
- **3.1_user_analytics/**: DAU/MAU, engagement, retention metrics
- **3.2_crowdsourced_curation/**: Community feedback and quality control
- **3.3_business_intelligence/**: Market insights and monetization data

### 4. INFRASTRUCTURE
Backend services, testing, and DevOps
- **4.1_backend_services/**: Supabase Edge Functions and database
- **4.2_testing_framework/**: Comprehensive test automation
- **4.3_devops/**: CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment automation

### 5. FUTURE_EXTENSIBILITY
AI coaching and scaling preparation
- **5.1_ai_coach_architecture/**: Voice analysis and personalized feedback
- **5.2_scaling_preparation/**: Microservices and enterprise features

## Key Improvements Over v3.31
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Eliminates runtime errors and improves maintainability
- ✅ **Modular Architecture**: Clear boundaries and testable components  
- ✅ **Secure API Integration**: Keys protected via backend functions
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Prevents UI regressions
- ✅ **Performance Focus**: Optimized caching and loading
- ✅ **Privacy Controls**: Clear opt-in for user recordings
- ✅ **Business Intelligence**: Rich analytics for growth insights

## Development Workflow
1. **Phase 1**: Foundation setup (TypeScript, testing, CI/CD)
2. **Phase 2**: Core functionality migration (TTS, UI, analytics)
3. **Phase 3**: Polish and Chrome Web Store preparation

## Getting Started
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

This v4.0 architecture provides a solid foundation for scaling NativeMimic from browser extension to comprehensive AI language learning platform.
